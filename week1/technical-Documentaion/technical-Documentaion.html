    <h1 id="Introduction">introduction about Js</h1>

    <p> JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known
        as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser
        environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
        developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard
        library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control
        structures, and statements. </p>
    <h1 id="features">Features of JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static,
                after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.
            </li>
            <li>
                Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be
                passed as arguments in other functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Can handle date and time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1 id="applications">Applications of JavaScript: </h1>

    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was
                invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language
                was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need
                to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because
                of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code.
                The Electron and React is helpful in this department.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Applications:</strong> With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to
                server and node.js is the most powerful on the server-side.</li>
            <li><strong>Games:</strong> Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure.
                The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It
                provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.</li>
            <li><strong>Smartwatches:</strong> JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It
                provides a library PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for
                applications that require the internet for its functioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Art:</strong> Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on
                HTML 5 canvas, and make the sound more effective also can be used <a
                    href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/p5-js-introduction/"><strong>p5.js</strong></a> library.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by
                using machine learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Applications: </strong>JavaScript can also be used to build an application for non-web
                contexts. The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications.
                This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build
                mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different
                systems. Write once use it anywhere!</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="history">History of JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
        It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named
        LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input
        or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host
        environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is
        the browser.
