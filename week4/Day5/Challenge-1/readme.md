# Coding Challenge 1
```javascript
// Coding Challenge #4
/*
Write a program that receives a list of variable names written in underscore_case and convert them to camelCase.
The input will come from a textarea inserted into the DOM (see code below), and conversion will happen when the button is pressed.
THIS TEST DATA (pasted to textarea)
underscore_case
 first_name
Some_Variable
  calculate_AGE
delayed_departure
SHOULD PRODUCE THIS OUTPUT (5 separate console.log outputs)
underscoreCase      :white_check_mark:
firstName           :white_check_mark::white_check_mark:
someVariable        :white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark:
calculateAge        :white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark:
delayedDeparture    :white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark:
HINT 1: Remember which character defines a new line in the textarea
HINT 2: The solution only needs to work for a variable made out of 2 words, like a_b
HINT 3: Start without worrying about the :white_check_mark:. Tackle that only after you have the variable name conversion working
HINT 4: This challenge is difficult on purpose, so start watching the solution in case you're stuck. Then pause and continue!
Afterwards, test with your own test data!
GOOD LUCK
